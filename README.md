## It doesn't always work.

Brotato is a game with a very large address space that changes dynamic pointers when the game is turned off and on. That's why the pointer in the code doesn't work for every person who installs it. To make it work, you need to replace the address space in the code with the address space where the coin value is stored. This code is just an example, I need to reverse engineer the game to bring it to life.
